# learn angular aot with ngc and webpack
A minified project to learn Angular5 aot with `ngc`(Angular compiler cli) and webpack. Also demonstrate how to import 3rd lib such as jQuery.

similar to https://github.com/csr632/angular-aot-demo-with-ngc-rollup, but this project use webpack instead of rollup, so **lazy loading Angular module** is possible.

# feature
This project use `ngc` to generate compiled Angular code **and write it to disk**, and then bundle the js code from disk. This make you be able to **observe the code generate by angular compiler**, and even **edit it** to see the difference! I think it is really helpful to understand & play with the "low-level machine code" of Angular.
> If you just want a minimum configuration to start building your own components to play with the ngc output, switch to [mini](https://github.com/csr632/angular-aot-demo-with-ngc-webpack/tree/mini) branch.

## command explain:
1. `npm run compile`: use `ngc`(angular compiler cli) to compile the "angular syntax" into js code(the "low-level machine code"). You can observe the output in `compile_output/`.
2. `npm run compile:watch`: same as `npm run compile`, except this command will also listen for files' change and emit latest compiled `.js` code.
3. `npm run webpack`: pack the whole application(including application code, angular framework, 3rd lib) into several bundles, based on the `webpack.config.js`. Note that the **output** of `ngc` is (part of) the **input** of webpack, so you must have finished `npm run compile[:watch]` before running this command.
4. `npm run serve`: first bundle the whole application(equivalent to `npm run webpack` but will emit files into **memory instead of disk**. Also, it will listen for files' change). Then serve the emitted files **from memory**. You must have finished `npm run compile[:watch]` before running this command (while `npm run webpack` is not required).
5. `npm run clean`: clean `dist/*`, `compile_output/*`.
6. `npm run aot`: `npm run clean && npm run compile && npm run webpack`.

## emit control
* [skipMetadataEmit](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#skipmetadataemit) in `tsconfig.json` determine whether or not **Angular Compiler** emit `.metadata.json` files.
* [skipTemplateCodegen](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler#skiptemplatecodegen) in `tsconfig.json` determine whether or not **Angular Compiler** emit `.ngfactory.js` and `.ngstyle.js` files.
* `declaration` in `tsconfig.json` determine whether or not **TypeScript Compiler** emit `.d.ts` definition files.
* `sourceMap` in `tsconfig.json` determine whether or not **TypeScript Compiler** emit `.js.map` sourcemap files.
